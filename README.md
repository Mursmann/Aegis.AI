# Aegis.AI â€“ Neural Protection Engine


Aegis.AI is an intelligent, adaptive host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) designed to protect both servers and personal computers from abnormal or malicious behavior using machine learning.

ðŸ”’ Project Summary
Aegis.AI leverages real-time system behavior monitoring and machine learning models to detect potential threats such as:

Unusual CPU or memory spikes

Sudden increases in the number of processes

Abnormal file system activity (e.g., mass file creation)

Unexpected network connections

Whether you're protecting a cloud server or a local desktop, Aegis.AI adapts to the behavior profile of the host to distinguish between normal and potentially dangerous activity.
